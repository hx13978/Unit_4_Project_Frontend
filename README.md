# Project-4(Frontend)

This React frontend app was designed to communicate with a Node/Express backend app to create a web application that will allow a user to create and display a Family/User Activity List. For all those busy individuals out there, this app will assist you in managing all your activities in a list sorted by date.

# Instructions

Upon loading the website, the user will be able to view their current Activity List.  The user can either delete an activity from their list by clicking on the "trash-can" button at the end of each activity, or they can create a new activity by completing the Create A New Activity form and clicking on the submit button located below the Activity List.  When an item is deleted, or added to the list, the Activity List shown on the page will be immediately updated and sorted by date in ascending order.
